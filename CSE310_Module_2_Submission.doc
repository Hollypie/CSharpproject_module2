      <h3>Time & Reflection</h3>
      <p><strong>How many hours did you spend on this module this Sprint? Include all time including planning, researching, implementation, troubleshooting, documentation, video production, and publishing.</strong><br>22 hours</p>
      <p><strong>Record your time log for each day here</strong><br>Monday, January 26<br><br>2 hours<br>Planning and project research. Watched C# videos and reviewed Udemy C# lessons.<br><br>Tuesday, January 27<br><br>4 hours<br>Created GitHub repository and started the project. Created planning documents (game system diagram). Watched additional C# tutorials and continued Udemy C# lessons. Installed required .NET libraries for dotnet run and dotnet build.<br>Note: Husband had major surgery this day; hospital stay interrupted coursework.<br><br>Wednesday, January 28<br><br>3 hours<br>Wrote initial code including Player class, Game class, and Program.cs menu logic for the console application.<br>In hospital.<br><br>Thursday, January 29<br><br>0 hours<br>Bringing husband home from the hospital. I included these details to explain the large gap in time working on project. <br><br>Friday, January 30<br><br>5 hours<br>Researched how to create, write, and read files using scripts. Built save and load logic.<br><br>Saturday, January 31<br><br>7 hours<br>Built SaveManager class, Enemy classes (using inheritance), LootManager class, and Item class. Recorded project video. Finished writing README.md. Submitted project. Project was beginning to gain bloat. I refactored the project and simplified it in order to complete in the required hours. <br><br>Monday, February 3<br><br>1 hour<br>Continued work on the project (additional development and refinement). and recorded loom video. and project submission.<br><br>Total Hours<br><br>Total Sprint Hours: 22 hours</p>
      <p><strong>What learning strategies worked well in this module and what strategies (or lack of strategy) did not work well? How can you improve in the next module?</strong><br>I chose this project as a preparation for the final module which I wanted to do on Game Frameworks where I will be using C# and Unity.  I spent time studying object oriented programming and I did my best to use classes and objects for this project. I spent a lot of time in the planning stages of this project. I wanted to be familiar with the type of coding I would be writing for unity when I do that. My biggest challenge was dealing with complexity creep and project bloat. Even the smallest additions tended to balloon out of control.  Something as simple as adding loot drops to the enemy encounters added a lot of complexity.  My biggest challenge was keeping things simple so that I could deliver a completed project. At one point I had to just delete features and code that I had created in favor of something less complex. My next module should be fairly straight forward. I have already begun research on that and I will be following some tutorials and online documentation content in order to create what I want to do. That should really help with the bloat since instead of going completely on my own I will have a guide to begin with. I'm excited to get started, I had fun with the first two modules which I did to prepare me for the final module.</p>
